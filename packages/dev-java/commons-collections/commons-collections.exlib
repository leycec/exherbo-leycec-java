SUMMARY="Java provider of common collection classes"
DESCRIPTION="
Apache Commons Collections builds upon the JDK collection classes by providing
new interfaces, implementations and utilities. These include:

    * Bag interface for collections that have a number of copies of each object
    * Buffer interface for collections that have a well defined removal order,
      like FIFOs
    * BidiMap interface for maps that can be looked up from value to key as well
      and key to value
    * MapIterator interface to provide simple and quick iteration over maps
    * Type checking decorators to ensure that only instances of a certain type
      can be added
    * Transforming decorators that alter each object as it is added to the
      collection
    * Composite collections that make multiple collections look like one
    * Ordered maps and sets that retain the order elements are added in,
      including an LRU based map
    * Identity map that compares objects based on their identity (==) instead of
      the equals method
    * Reference map that allows keys and/or values to be garbage collected under
      close control
    * Many comparator implementations
    * Many iterator implementations
    * Adapter classes from array and enumerations to collections
    * Utilities to test or create typical set-theory properties of collections
      such as union, intersection, and closure
