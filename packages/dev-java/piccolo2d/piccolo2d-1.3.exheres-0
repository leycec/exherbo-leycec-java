# Piccolo2D requires Maven as of version 1.3. Maven is horrible, however. Thus,
# this exlib ignores Maven "pom.xml" files and instead simply creates a skeleton
# Ant "build.xml" file with which it then builds. Fortunately, as Piccolo2D only
# depends upon SWT, this is a very simple build process. (Why did they ever move
# to Maven? O, the lamentable power of hype.)
#
# Set this prior to requiring "piccolo2d", as that exlib requires "googlecode"
# which in turn accesses this global.
