SUMMARY="Java toolkit for developing Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs)"
DESCRIPTION="
Piccolo2D is a Java toolkit supporting the development of 2D structured graphics
programs, in general, and Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs), in particular. A ZUI
is a new kind of interface presenting a huge canvas of information on a
traditional computer display by letting the user smoothly zoom in (to obtain
detailed information) and zoom out (to obtain an overview). Piccolo2d uses a so-
called \"scene graph\" model common to 3D environments. So, Piccolo2D maintains
a hierarchal structure of objects and cameras, allowing application developers
to orient, group, and manipulate objects in interactive, meaningful ways.

# The former has the Piccolo2D core, while the latter has the Piccolo2D SWT
# integration. Both are needed (e.g., by Cytoscape); thus both are built.
