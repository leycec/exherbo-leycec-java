SUMMARY="Free implementation of the Java Transaction API (JTA)"
DESCRIPTION="
The Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation
of the Java Transaction API (JTA).  It is a fully working XA transaction manager
that provides all services required by the JTA API, while trying to keep the
code as simple as possible for easier understanding of the XA semantics.
