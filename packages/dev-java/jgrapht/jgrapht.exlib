SUMMARY="Java graph library providing graph-theory objects and algorithms"
DESCRIPTION="
JGraphT is a free Java graph library providing mathematical graph-theory objects
and algorithms. It supports various types of graphs, including:

    * directed and undirected graphs.
    * graphs with weighted / unweighted / labeled or any user-defined edges.
    * various edge multiplicity options, including: simple-graphs, multigraphs, pseudographs.
    * unmodifiable graphs - allow modules to provide "read-only" access to internal graphs.
    * listenable graphs - allow external listeners to track modification events.
    * subgraphs graphs that are auto-updating subgraph views on other graphs.
    * all compositions of above graphs.

Although powerful, JGraphT is designed to be simple and type-safe (via Java
generics). For example, graph vertices can be of any objects. You can create
graphs based on: Strings, URLs, XML documents, etc; you can even create graphs
of graphs! Other features offered by JGraphT include:

    * graph visualization using the JGraph library.
    * complete source code included, under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
    * comprehensive Javadocs.
    * easy extensibility.
