SUMMARY="Java libraries for high performance scientific and technical computing."
DESCRIPTION="
Colt is a collection of Java libraries for high performance scientific and
technical computing. It is particularly useful in the domain of high energy
physics at CERN: it contains, among others, efficient and usable data structures
and algorithms for offline and online data analysis, linear algebra, multi-
dimensional arrays, statistics, histogramming, Monte Carlo simulation, and
parallel and concurrent programming. It summons some of the best concepts,
designs and implementations thought up over time by the community, ports or
improves them and introduces new approaches where need arises. In overlapping
areas, it is competitive or superior to toolkits such as STL, Root, HTL, CLHEP,
TNT, GSL, C-RAND / WIN-RAND, (all C/C++) as well as  IBM Array and JDK 1.2
Collections framework (all Java).
