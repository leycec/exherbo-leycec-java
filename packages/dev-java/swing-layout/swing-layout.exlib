SUMMARY="Java extensions for simplifying Swing layout"
DESCRIPTION="
Swing Layout Extensions goal is to make it easy to create professional cross-
platform layouts with Swing. This project has an eye towards the needs of GUI
builders, such as NetBeans. It consists of the following pieces:

    * Ability to get the baseline for components.
    * Ability to get the preferred gap between components.
    * A new LayoutManager that utilizes both of these concepts and is tuned toward a
    * free-form drag and drop layout model as can be provided by GUI builders.
