SUMMARY="Java database connection pooling API"
DESCRIPTION="
Commons DBCP is a Java database connection pooling API. It provides developers a
\"pool\" of open connections shared between all of the application's current
users. This is made feasible due to the likelihood the number of users actually
performing a request at any given time is a very small percentage of the total
number of active users, and during request processing is the only time that a
database connection is required. Commons DBCP coordinate the efforts required to
create and maintain an efficient, feature-rich package for solving such problems.

#FIXME: Add support for testing. This will be painful, due to the unit tests'
#dependency on external exheres: commons-logging, tomcat, and more.
